Convert the attached file to CSS by following the given instructions.

1. For every entry in primitives.color, name them following lower case (color-primary-100). 
Take the specified value and convert it to rgb (ignore the alpha value), as these will be used like so: rbga(var(var_name))
Ouput it as var_name: number, number, number;

2. for semantics.font and semantics["stroke normal"], follow the same conventions as specified in step 1, except correctly point to the specified primitive.

3. Ignore typography.

4. every entry in the font property should be converted to a class. (Title, H1, etc.)
Convert units to rem if defined where 1rem = 20px. 
Disregard the extensions property. 
Follow the TitleCase naming convention (e.g.: BodyLargeHeavy, H1, Title, etc.)
use the default font color for each font

5. for color variables, group them as primitive and semantic, providing a comment to indicate where one starts.

set the background color of the body to the default background color

remove all default styling for text (headings, spans, etc.)

adjust rem size with the following min-width breakpoints:
- html: 14px
- 576: 15px
- 768: 16px
- 992: 17px
- 1200: 18px

6. in root, add global variables:
- "--page-max-width: 70rem"

DO NOT CONVERT UNLESS A PREVIOUS CSS FILE IS ATTACHED TO THE PROMPT.
Reference the previous css file to maintain naming conventions.
